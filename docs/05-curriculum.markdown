This page gathers learning materials for AI+HEP, both from the HEP side and the AI side, presented in formats including ``jupyter notebooks`` and ``pdf`` files. They are intended for students new to the field to quickly get familiar with common tools, datasets, and research questions, as well as basic concepts in physics and AI necessary to comprehend the current literature. You may also find small hands-on projects here, designed to better prepare you for your own research. Students are encouraged to learn it at your own pace and to see if you're interested in further pursuing this line of research. 

**To Mentors:** Thanks everyone for uploading your own teaching materials! It really helps the community to share educational resources and together we become far more efficient. In the future once we have enough materials, we will try to organize them into a coherent curriculum. Right now, don't worry about organizing, formatting, etc. Just upload the materials you find useful under the respective topic tab (and they don't need to match perfectly). In most cases, a link to another website, a Github repo, or an arXiv paper would be enough. But note that this is not a place for posting current literature. So please don't post new papers, review articles, white papers, unless they have a strong educational value. Tutorials for summer/winter schools fit perfectly here, as well as coursera courses on CS/AI/HEP that you find helpful. Thanks again!
