Every year, we host a week-long in-person workshop in the East Asia region to bring together researchers working in the interdisciplinary field of Artificial Intelligence and High Energy Physics (AI+HEP), broadly defined. Our goal is to better promote communications and foster collaborations. In addition to research presentations, we hope to have a different **Focused Topic** each year, to highlight one specific direction and/or an adjacent field. The ultimate goal is to gradually form a set of new, well-defined, and meaningful scientific questions in AI+HEP and chart out a path for the development of the field in the coming decades.

Students, postdocs, junior researchers are particularly welcomed to attend. The future of our field is yours to define!
